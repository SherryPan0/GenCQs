1. What are the main components of human-computer interaction in terms of input and output modalities?
2. How can user abilities (e.g., sensory and motor skills) influence the design of an adaptive user interface?
3. What types of physical devices are used for input and output modalities in HCI?
4. How can an ontology be used to model the interaction between users and computer systems?
5. What rules and inference mechanisms are applied to adapt user interfaces based on user profiles?
6. How do different levels of user capacities (e.g., Good, Moderate, Low, Severe) affect the selection of interaction modalities?
7. What is the role of Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) in defining adaptation rules for user interfaces?
8. How can ontologies help in personalizing interactive systems for users with disabilities?
9. What are the relationships between modes, modalities, and media in human-computer interaction?
10. How can user preferences and skills be integrated into the ontology for adaptive user interfaces?
11. What are the benefits of using ontological reasoning to design personalized user interfaces?
12. How can multimodal systems be designed to support various interaction modalities?
13. How does the context (e.g., location, time, current activity) influence user interaction in adaptive systems?
14. What are the key factors to consider when designing adaptive interfaces for users with different sensory and motor capacities?
15. How can interactive systems ensure accessibility for users with severe impairments?
