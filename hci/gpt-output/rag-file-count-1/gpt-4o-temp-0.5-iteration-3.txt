1. What is the definition of a modality in the context of human-computer interaction?
2. How do input modalities differ from output modalities in an adaptive user interface?
3. What are the different types of user characteristics that impact the choice of interaction modalities?
4. How can physical and sensory impairments of users influence the design of an interface?
5. What reasoning mechanisms can be used to adapt interfaces according to user profiles?
6. How can SWRL rules be utilized to derive appropriate interface parameters for specific user profiles?
7. What are the main components of the proposed interaction ontology?
8. How do capacities to see, hear, move, and talk affect the derivation of input and output modalities?
9. What criteria define the levels of user capabilities (Good, Moderate, Low, Severe) in the ontology?
10. How can multiple modalities be combined or made redundant in an adaptive interface?
11. What is the role of medium in the interaction component of an HCI system?
12. How does the interaction ontology support the automatic adaptation of user interfaces?
13. What future extensions are suggested for the ontological approach to adaptive interfaces?
14. What are the challenges in achieving semantic interoperability across different platforms using ontologies?
15. How does the context ontology (like CoDAMoS) contribute to application adaptation and user interface generation?
