1. What are the key characteristics that define user profiles in HCI?
2. How can user sensory and motor capabilities be represented in an HCI ontology?
3. What modalities are available for user input and output interaction?
4. How is modality selection determined based on user characteristics?
5. What adaptation rules can be applied to tailor interfaces for users with disabilities?
6. How can different levels of user capacity (e.g., good, moderate, low, severe) affect interaction modalities?
7. What types of physical and logical interaction components are included in an HCI ontology?
8. How does the ontology model user preferences, skills, and education level?
9. What are the relationships between modes, modalities, and mediums in HCI?
10. How can ontological reasoning be used to infer suitable interaction modalities?
11. What is the impact of user context (e.g., location, activity) on interface adaptation?
12. How can an ontology-based approach improve the design of multimodal user interfaces?
13. What are the key challenges in creating adaptive interfaces for users with different disabilities?
14. How does the proposed ontology ensure that all users are able to interact with the system using at least one modality?
15. What role do semantic web technologies play in the interoperability and reasoning capabilities of HCI ontologies?
