1. What are the key sensory systems involved in human-computer interaction?
2. How can user abilities (e.g., vision, hearing, speech, motor skills) be modeled in an ontology?
3. What parameters are essential for adapting the user interface based on user abilities?
4. How do different input and output modalities relate to user profiles?
5. What role do physical devices (e.g., keyboard, mouse, screen, speaker) play in human-computer interaction ontologies?
6. How can an ontology support multimodal interaction in adaptive systems?
7. What rules can be defined to adapt interface parameters based on user sensory capabilities?
8. How can an ontology help in predicting the most suitable interface for a user with disabilities?
9. What are the relationships between interaction modes, modalities, and mediums in an HCI ontology?
10. How can reasoning on an interaction ontology ensure consistency and infer high-level data?
11. What types of input and output interactions can be modeled in an HCI ontology?
12. How can adaptation rules be structured to accommodate changes in user abilities over time?
13. In what ways can semantic reasoning enhance the interaction experience for users with varying abilities?
14. What are the core entities (e.g., user, environment, platform, service) in a context-aware HCI ontology?
15. How can an ontology-based approach improve the socio-economic conditions of users by enhancing their interaction with systems?
