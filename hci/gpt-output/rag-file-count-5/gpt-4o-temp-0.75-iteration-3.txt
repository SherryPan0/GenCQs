1. What are the main characteristics of a user interacting with a computer system?
2. How are different user capabilities like sensory, motor, cognitive, and speech, modeled in an ontology?
3. What are the types of disabilities that need to be considered in an adaptive user interface?
4. How do user characteristics influence the adaptation of input and output modalities in an interactive system?
5. What types of interaction components (mode, modality, and medium) are essential for human-computer interaction?
6. How can an ontology be used to reason about user characteristics and interface parameters to generate adaptive interfaces?
7. What are the different assistive technologies and adaptive strategies used to support people with disabilities in interacting with ICTs?
8. How are user profiles and context modeled in an adaptive system ontology?
9. What are the common properties and relationships used in ontologies to represent interaction components and user characteristics?
10. How can activity-centered design (ACD) be integrated into an ontology to improve user interactions with ICTs?
11. How are multimodal interfaces defined and what are their components in human-computer interaction?
12. What are the key components and rules in a rule-based reasoning system for user interface adaptation?
13. How does the capability of a user to perform activities influence the design of interactive systems?
