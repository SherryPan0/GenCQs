1. What are the main characteristics of users interacting with a given ICT system?
2. How can users be classified based on their cognitive, motor, sensory, and speech capabilities?
3. What types of disabilities are associated with specific impairments in ICT users?
4. How can the interaction between users and a computer system be modeled to support adaptive interface design?
5. What types of support assistance (hardware, software, or strategies) can be recommended to users with specific disabilities and capabilities?
6. How are activities performed by users in daily life identified and categorized in the context of HCI?
7. What technological adaptations are necessary to meet the specific needs of users with disabilities?
8. How can user profiles be used to predict the next likely action of a user based on past interactions?
9. What are the critical data elements and properties needed to represent user interactions and ICT system adaptations?
10. How can multi-modal interactions (e.g., speech, gestures) be incorporated into user interface design to improve accessibility?
11. What role do context and environment play in adaptive user interface systems?
12. How can ontologies be used to infer new information about users from existing data regarding their interactions with ICT systems?
13. What are the essential components of a semantic layer for adaptive systems in HCI?
14. How do different user modeling algorithms integrate into adaptive interactive system frameworks?
15. What adaptations improve user-system interaction, particularly for users with different levels of experience or specific disabilities?
