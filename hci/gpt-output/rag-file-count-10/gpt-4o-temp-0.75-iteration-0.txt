1. What are the core elements involved in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)?
2. How do user characteristics such as abilities, preferences, and skills affect the design of user interfaces in HCI?
3. What are the different types of interaction modalities (e.g., visual, auditory, tactile) used in HCI?
4. How can ontologies be utilized to model user interactions in adaptive systems?
5. What are the specific input modes and output modes used in HCI, and how are they defined?
6. How can adaptive interfaces be generated based on user profiles using ontological modeling and reasoning?
7. What is the role of semantic technologies in enhancing interoperability and reasoning in HCI systems?
8. How can user impairments and disabilities be represented and used to adapt HCI systems?
9. What support assistance (hardware, software, or adaptive strategies) is recommended for users with specific disabilities and capabilities?
10. How do multimodal interfaces incorporate multiple modalities such as speech, gesture, and writing?
11. What are the key factors to be considered when designing user interfaces for individuals with disabilities?
12. How can user interactions with ICT systems be modeled to support accessibility and activity-centered design?
13. What are the methodologies for reverse engineering and forward engineering in creating HCI ontologies?
14. How are interaction constraints related to available devices and user sensory and motor abilities modeled in HCI ontologies?
15. How can user modeling and context-aware adaptation techniques be applied to create personalized user interfaces in pervasive environments?
