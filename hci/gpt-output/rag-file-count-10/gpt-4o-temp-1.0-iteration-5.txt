1. What are the core components of human-computer interaction (HCI) systems?
2. How are user profiles represented in HCI ontologies?
3. What types of interaction modes are identified in HCI systems?
4. How are different modalities (e.g., visual, auditory, tactile) represented in an HCI ontology?
5. What types of devices serve as input and output media in HCI systems?
6. How are user preferences and skills accounted for in adaptive HCI systems?
7. What rules govern the adaptation of user interfaces in HCI systems?
8. How does the ontology differentiate between different user interaction methods (e.g., gestures vs. voice commands)?
9. What are the key user characteristics that influence interface adaptation in HCI?
10. How is context (e.g., location, time) represented in HCI ontologies to influence interaction?
11. What role do haptic interfaces play in HCI, and how are they modeled in an ontology?
12. How are multimodal interfaces designed and represented in HCI ontologies?
13. What methods and algorithms are used for user modeling and interface adaptation in HCI systems?
14. How is semantic reasoning used to ensure ontology consistency and interface adaptability in HCI?
15. How do HCI systems manage and integrate sensor data for context-aware interactions?
