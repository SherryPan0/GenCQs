1. What are the different input modalities available for user interaction in HCI?
2. How can user characteristics (e.g., ability to see, to talk, to move) be used to generate an adaptive user interface?
3. What output modalities can be used for visually impaired users in an adaptive user interface?
4. How does the severity of a user's physical impairments affect the choice of input and output modalities?
5. What types of devices are considered input mediums in HCI?
6. What is the role of ontologies in modeling user interactions within adaptive systems?
7. How can SWRL rules be used to define adaptation rules for user interfaces?
8. What are the key components of an interaction ontology in HCI?
9. How are different sensory modalities (visual, auditory, tactile) represented within the HCI ontology?
10. What inference engines can be used to reason about OWL-defined concepts and properties in HCI ontologies?
11. How can ontologies support the personalization and adaptation of user interfaces based on user profiles?
12. What methodologies are commonly used for constructing HCI ontologies (e.g., Methontology)?
13. What relations exist between modes, modalities, and mediums in an HCI interaction model?
14. How can the redundancy of multiple modalities (e.g., visual and speech) be managed in interface design?
15. How are user modeling algorithms integrated into the framework of adaptive interactive systems?
