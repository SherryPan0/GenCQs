Your purpose is to organizing scientific data in an openly available and long-term way with respect to building, publishing, and evaluating an initial Knowledge Graph of empirical research in Requirement Engineering. To achieve this goal, you need to create an knowledge graph which enables sustainable literature reviews to synthesize a comprehensive, up-to-date, and long-term available overview of the state and evolution of empirical research in Requirement Engineering. To create such a knowledge graph, you first need to come up with some competency questions. An competency question is a natural language question that represents an information need related to the content of a knowledge graph and for which a knowledge graph must provide relevant information to anwser the question. Now you are given a set of documents about the state and evolution of this field.\",\n",
